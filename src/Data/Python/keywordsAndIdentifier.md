# KeyWords and Identifiers

## Keywords

Just like any other language out there, Python also has few reserved words which hold special meaning and are called Keywords.

**Pointers on Keywords**

- Keywords can't be used as a variable name, function name, or name of other entities.
- Keywords are case sensitive.
- All the Keywords starts with small letter except for ` True, False, and None`.

As of Python 3.8, there are 35 Keywords.

| Keywords | Keywords | Keywords | Keywords |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| False    | class    | from     | or       |
| None     | continue | global   | pass     |
| True     | def      | if       | raise    |
| and      | del      | import   | return   |
| as       | elif     | in       | try      |
| assert   | else     | is       | while    |
| async    | except   | lambda   | with     |
| await    | finally  | nonlocal | yield    |
